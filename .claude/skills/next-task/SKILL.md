description: Implement the next unchecked task in the current phase

# Next task

1. Read `docs/PROGRESS.md` and the current `docs/tasks/phase-N.md`.
2. Pick the first unchecked task. Read only its referenced SPEC sections.
3. Post a short plan (files, approach, tests). If the task touches upstream (non-kit) files, dependencies, secret generation, backup/restore/upgrade logic, bot policy/handoff rules, anything destructive, or any real client host or customer data, wait for approval.
4. Implement. Run `opskit/bin/check --quick` after significant steps.
5. Write the required tests.
6. Run `opskit/bin/check`. Fix failures by reading real errors.
7. Check the task off, update `docs/PROGRESS.md` (files changed, how to verify manually, issues).
8. Commit with a conventional commit message.
9. Stop. Summarize what was done and what's next.
